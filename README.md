Problems today

1. Most Medical centers receive appointments by phone
1. At most they use their own web pages

    * This means that users have to either enter data each time they make an appointment or they have to sign-in at many different institutions.
    
1. Appointments are managed at institution level, not at physician level.
    * There is no way for a patient to optimize appointments for a particular physician across different institutions.
    
1. Most systems do not manage cancelations and appointment confirmations.

1. No-shows are big looses and are difficult to prevent today
    * To prevent no-shows schedules are over-booked.
        * Poor service
        * Extended sessions for physicians
        
1. Costs involved
    * Call Centers (institutions)
    * No-shows (physicians)
    * Poor customer service (users / institutions)
        
Solution

1. Use smartphone app to make, confirm, update, cancel appointments.
    * Platforms
        * iOS
        * Android
        * W8

Functionality

1. User profile encrypted on device. (no external database)
1. Central database for physicians, institutions
1. Calendar integration

        * Multi-protocol (iCalendar, iCal, etc)
1. Integration with IVR
1. Call Center interphase

1. Highlights
    * Peer-to-peer updates --> User and physician calendars involved in transactions.
    * Customized alerts --> Physicians could set up alarms for low number of patients scheduled.
    * Two sided appointment cancelation --> Appointments can be cancelled easily by Institutions and physicians. 
    * Queue management --> Users can be alerted of closer free appointments and switch a later appointment to this one.
